    "So far we have conducted a human analysis, but the real power of Tornasole comes from having automatic monitoring of training runs. To do so we will build a SageMaker-based system that monitors existing runs in real time. Data traces deposited in S3 are the exchange mechanism: \n",
    "- the training system deposits data into s3://mybucket/myrun/\n",
    "- the monitoring system watches and reads data from s3://mybucket/myrun/\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will simulate that situation. The only difference from SageMaker-based system is that data traces have been stored locally, not in S3, so we will use previously created `LocalTrial` objects and run rule on them."
